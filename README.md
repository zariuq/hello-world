hello-world
===========

Just another repository, mang.

THIS REPOSITORY IS JUST FOR PRACTICE. DO NOT WORRY IF IT PSYCHOLOGICALLY DISTURBS YOU.
MOVE ON QUICKLY IF YOU START GETTING MOVEMENTS WITHIN.
THAT BE ALL, FOLKS.


Wow, great, I jumped the gun and wrote the readme early in the tutorial.  Well, I'm Bob. Coding is fun and many algorithms and languages are cool, but I'm too lazy to get good at any of them (again) (so far).

Let's make this hello-world the most friendly greeting out there~ (・ω・）ノ
